## DocuNarrator: Narrate Your Life

Inspired by a fun and entertaining Twitter post, I created DocuNarrator. It's not perfect, but I hope you enjoy it! Check out more of my work [here](https://ren-s-portfolio.web.app).

## Want to make your own AI app?
Check out [Replicate](https://replicate.com). They make it easy to run machine learning models with an API.

## Setup

Clone this repo, and setup and activate a virtualenv:

```bash
python3 -m pip install virtualenv
python3 -m virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, install the dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Make a [Replicate](https://replicate.com), [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/), and [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) account and set your tokens:

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<token>
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=<eleven-token>
```

Make a new voice in Eleven and get the voice id of that voice using their [get voices](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/voices) API, or by clicking the flask icon next to the voice in the VoiceLab tab.

```
export ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=<voice-id>
```

## Run it!

In on terminal, run the webcam capture:
```bash
python capture.py
```
In another terminal, run the narrator:

```bash
python narrator.py
```
